# Knowledge-synthesis with the interdisciplinary approach of Hierarchology and hierarchography
Hierarchology is the interdisciplinary science that investigates hierarchical associative systems across human cognition, social structures, and natural ecosystems, whereas hierarchography (coined by Karl Petrič 2022) denotes the methodologies for describing, visualizing, and archiving these hierarchies through multifaceted data representations. Hierarchography encompasses the methods and techniques for describing, visualizing, and recording hierarchical associative systems, as a complement to hierarchology.
These techniques employ hybrid approaches, integrating verbal, pictorial or visual, auditory, tactile, and motor data forms to capture and represent intricate relationships within such systems.[5]
Elaborated in Petrič's 2025 publication, hierarchography facilitates model construction and precise delineation of interconnections, distinguishing itself from hierarchology's emphasis on systemic analysis by focusing on representational and documentation practices.
Knowledge synthesis on the basic of polyhierarchical models with user profiles
A multidimensional rank thesaurus, mapping concepts across topics/profiles/events/contexts with rankings, could boost AI reasoning: better disambiguation, cross-domain analogies, adaptation to thinking styles, and fewer hallucinations. Key for bridging everyday/scientific thought
Polyhierarchical knowledge models: we can freely add new dimensions (user profiles, interests, cognitive styles) without breaking the structure. This enables richer personalization and deeper reasoning in AI-driven knowledge and topic recommendation. Flexible, modular, powerful.
Central class ProgramType (X users Science/Engineering) connects downward to several UserProfile, InterestFacet, and Subjectclasses. Arrows as rankedRelevance, partOf, and motivatesThrough show the relationships, representing personalization for X users in science and engineering.
Multi-dimensional rank thesaurus: UserProfiles converge upon RankTopics, unveiling layered realms, from TheoreticalFoundations, PhilosophicalImplications, science etc. Person A, B, C, D ... stand as exemplars in this relational ontology of knowledge.
New ideas could emerge by combining person A innovation focus, person B critical insights, and persons C&D idea production. Collaborative ontology mapping and interdisciplinary dialogue can spark breakthroughs in tech, science, society.
About the tool Knowledge Synthesizer: it is open source. You can use it but you need your own Groq key. The free plan gives you 100,000 tokens per day. Platform: Streamlit.
